## Why use Flyt? ##

**Flyt** was developed to provide developers the strength of jQuery type DOM manipulation without the concern
of excess baggage. While jQuery is widely used and viably the most popular JS library in use today, those
striving for performance with minimal overhead are going to love what Flyt has to offer.

More is not always better, and the goal with Flyt is to keep it minimalistic without sacrificing functionality.
This will always be the goal of Flyt. 

**Minified Flyt is less than 4kb! Compared to jQuery, over 100kb.**

## How to use Flyt? ##

Using Flyt is going to be easy for those familiar with libraries like jQuery as it follows similar principles. 

To initiate a new Flyt object, simply pass an tag name, class or id:


    var body = flyt("body")

or 

	var body = _f("body")

It's that simple! 

Once the new Flyt object is created, you can initiate any of the built in functions. For example:

	body.addClass("name");

A list of available functions, please read the documentation.
